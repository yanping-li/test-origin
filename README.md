note that it will only run successfully on Linux machines.

## Testing

The test suite isn't explicitly mentioned in the articles, but if you'd like to
run the tests you'll need to install [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)
and [gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega).  Note that some of the tests may
require root privileges.
